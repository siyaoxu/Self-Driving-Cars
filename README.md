## Self-Driving-Cars
This is my projects for the Udacity Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree. Currently I have completed Term 1 of this program, and have started Term 2. Projects I have completed are listed below:

### Term 1

#### Project 1: [Simple Lane Detection](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1)
Detect straight lane lines with image filter and fit two straight lines for them.

#### Project 2: [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project)
Train an image classifier with Convolutional Neural Network to automaticaly identify multiple categories of traffic signs. Various strategies have been used to augment images of the training dataset.

#### Project 3: [Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/blob/master/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/img_writeup/Demo_augmentations.PNG)
Record images using a vehicle simulator, train a Deep Neural Network with augmented images, and drive the vehicle using this neural network model

#### Project 4: [Advanced Lane Detection](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines)
Implement a pipeline for lane detection, wrap this pipeline in a script, and apply the script to detect lane lines in a footnote. The pipeline includes camera calibration, raw image undistortion, a combination of a set of complex image filters, perspective transform, curve lane searching and fitting, and curvature radius calculation.

#### Project 5: [Vehicle Detection](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-Vehicle-Detection)
Implement a pipeline to detect vehicles in a video footnote. The pipeline includes extract features from images, train a linear SVM image classifier, design multiscale searching grid to scan contents in frames of the video, and filter incorrect prediciton with heatmaps of the latest n frames of the video.

### Term 2

#### Project 1 - 3: [Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project), [Unscented Kalman Filter](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project), [Particle Filter](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project)
Implement Bayesian filters with C++ for data fusion.

#### Project 4 - 5: [PID Control](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-PID-Control-Project) and [Model Predictive Control](https://github.com/siyaoxu/Self-Driving-Cars/tree/master/CarND-MPC-Project)
Implement two control systems: PID control and MPC control to keep vehicles driving on expected path. The results can be approached at [here for PID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjSdukz44Go&feature=youtu.be) and [here for MPC](https://youtu.be/DjfHubgWDHA)
